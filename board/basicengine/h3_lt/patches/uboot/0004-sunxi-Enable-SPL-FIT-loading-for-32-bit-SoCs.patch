Subject: [PATCH 04/13] sunxi: Enable SPL FIT loading for 32-bit SoCs

Now that 32-bit SoCs can load U-Boot proper (and possibly other
firmware) from a FIT, use this method by default. SPL_FIT_IMAGE_TINY is
required to stay within the 24 or 32 KiB SPL size limit on early SoCs;
for consistency, enable it everywhere.

Cover-letter:
sunxi: SPL FIT support for 32-bit sunxi SoCs
This series makes the necessary changes so 32-bit sunxi SoCs can load
additional device trees or firmware from SPL along with U-Boot proper.
Crust (SCP firmware) has support for A33 and H3, and H3 also needs to
load an eGon blob to support CPU 0 hotplug (a silicon bug workaround).

FIT unlocks more features (signatures, multiple DTBs, etc.), so enable
it by default. A10 (sun4i) only has 24 KiB of SRAM A1, so it needs
SPL_FIT_IMAGE_TINY. For consistency, enable that option everywhere.

After this series is applied, we can increase SPL_MAX_SIZE for H6 and
newer SoCs, both 32-bit (e.g. A50, T113) and 64-bit. I did not do that
yet because there is some discussion to be had about the correct value:
it must be adjusted to guarantee return-to-FEL functionality, and the
exact adjustment depends on the sunxi-fel tool implementation.
